# project-landingpage
Landing page project for The Odin Project curriculum.
I looked up a ton of stuff in order to get this done. I went to bed most nights obessing about how to get the code just right. I essentially had this project engrained in me from the onset. I had a ton of fun with it. I will come back later and change a few things (mainly text and pictures maybe), but for now it is done.
